### setup

```{r message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
options(digits = 22, scipen = 999)
```

### creating data

```{r}
df = data.frame(date = as_date(as_date("1901-01-01"):as_date("2000-12-31")))
sample_n(df, 10)
```

### creating day variable

```{r}
df = df |>
  mutate(day_num = day(date))

sample_n(df, 10)
```

### creating weekday variable

```{r}
df = df |>
  mutate(weekday = wday(date, label = T, abbr = F))

sample_n(df, 10)
```

### solution

```{r}
n = df |>
  filter(day_num == 1 & weekday == "Sunday") |>
  nrow()

paste0("during the twentieth centurty, there were ", n, " sundays that fell on the first of the month")
```
